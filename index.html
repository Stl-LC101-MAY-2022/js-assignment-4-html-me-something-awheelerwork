      <header id="testP"class="funParagraph">If I was to take a trip around the world there are many places I would 
      like to visit. If I was to take a trip like in the book around the world in 
      80 days. There are a few places that I would want to spend the majority of
      my time.

   <p> The first stop would be Hawaii. Hawaii is a beautiful archipelago. I would
      love to island hop and visit all of them. Avoiding visiting in November and 
      December is a good idea as they are the rainiest months of the year. There are 
      so many fun and exciting things to do. Hawaii has a unique culture unlike any 
      other state in the US. Days elasped surfing and island hopping 20, 60 days left
      of my journey.

      </div>  
       <p> The next stop would have to be Japan. I've been interested in Japan since
         I was a small child taking karate. Since then I've studied many more styles most 
         of them originated in Japan. Japan has a has a large range of climates for a
          relatively small island nation. Japan is about the same size as California. 
          The climate ranges from subartic in the north and subtropical in the south. 
          If I was to visit during the winter months I would want to be in Hokkaido to
          go snowboarding in the mountains. If I was to visit during the summer months I 
          would want to be in Okinawa in the south surfing on the beach. Days elasped surfing, 
          snowboarding and eating sushi 25, 35 days left of my journey.

       <footer> The final stop would be more of a series of stops. I would start in Greece and 
         make my way west to Italy, then north to Germany. I would be doing the equivalent
         of a speed dating run through as many countries and cities as possible. There are 
         too many things I want to do in Europe to list them all here. There are castles, mountains,
          beaches, historical sites, and museums. Then there is the food, the wine, and the beer.
          Every country has their own culinary contributions. Years of working in restaurants has given 
          me an appreciation for really good food and drink. Days spent catching trains and gaining 
          weight 30. The unaccounted 5 days would be used for travel between these area and finally back 
          home.
